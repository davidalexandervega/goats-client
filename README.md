# GoatsGuide

**If you know about an upcoming concert, fest, or tour share the flier here. [goatsguide.com](https://goatsguide.com)**

This is a DIY bulletin board for poster artwork and event information.
If you want to copy/paste from an event already on Facebook or upload an old flier,
that would be a great way contribute.

View more artwork and events from an international scope, as they get posted.
Archive digital references to fliers and shows from your past.

<br/>

**Post a new flier. Select from 'Single Show', 'Fest', or 'Tour' templates. Complete the event form to make the artwork more searchable.**

<br/>

**Keep your fliers and their events updated. Cancel all tourstops or event dates affected. Cancelling all events on a flier will show a notification tag on the public version.**
